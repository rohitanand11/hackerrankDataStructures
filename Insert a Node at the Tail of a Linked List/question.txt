You are given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer. Insert this node at the tail of the linked list and return the head node of the linked list formed after inserting this new node. The given head pointer may be null, meaning that the initial list is empty.

Input Format

You have to complete the SinglyLinkedListNode insertAtTail(SinglyLinkedListNode head, int data) method. It takes two arguments: the head of the linked list and the integer to insert at tail. You should not read any input from the stdin/console.
